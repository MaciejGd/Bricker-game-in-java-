# Bricker-game-in-java-

Here is java Bricker Game written using javax.swing library. 
The goal is to destroy every brick with a ball bouncing off the paddle. Every 11 destroyed blocks drops a bonus, which player can obtain by touching it with a paddle. The game is over when a player destroys every brick(that is a win) or all off the balls go out of screen(that is a loss). I also added a part of code to play music in a game and play a sound of destroying brick.
